  h2-hash Before You Get Started
  p Sinco provides support for running your tests inside Docker. It only requires just over half a dozen lines inside a dockerfile to install the chrome-driver and you should be ready to go.
  p Other than that, there are no other changes required, and the rest of Sinco's documentation still applies.
  P The ability to run your Browser tests from within a docker container is very useful, because (as containers can be networked together), you could go to your website, test your <code>/register</code> page works when creating a user, and then clean up (delete the user) from your database - whether that's importing your 'User model' and deleting it manually.
  p In this tutorial, you will:
  ul
    li Create a docker container, that installs Deno and chrome-driver; and
    li Create a headless browser instance from within Docker;
    li Go to a page;
    li Assert that you are on the expected web page.

    li
      p Create your dockerfile.
      code-block(title="/path/to/your/project/app.dockerfile" language="dockerfile")
        | FROM debian:stable-slim
        |
        | # Install chrome driver
        | RUN apt update -y && apt clean -y
        | RUN apt install gnupg -y
        | ENV CHROME_VERSION "google-chrome-stable"
        | RUN sed -i -- 's&deb http://deb.debian.org/debian jessie-updates main&#deb http://deb.debian.org/debian jessie-updates main&g' /etc/apt/sources.list \
        |   && apt-get update && apt-get install wget -y
        | RUN wget -q -O - https://dl-ssl.google.com/linux/linux_signing_key.pub | apt-key add - \
        |   && echo "deb http://dl.google.com/linux/chrome/deb/ stable main" >> /etc/apt/sources.list \
        |   && apt-get update && apt-get -qqy install ${CHROME_VERSION:-google-chrome-stable}
        |
        | # Install deno
        | RUN apt install curl unzip -y
        | RUN curl -fsSL https://deno.land/x/install/install.sh | DENO_INSTALL=/usr/local sh
        | RUN export DENO_INSTALL="/root/.local"
        | RUN export PATH="$DENO_INSTALL/bin:$PATH"
      p Here, you are using a very small image (debian-slim) as your baseline for your docker container. Then you install the chrome-driver, which allows Sinco to create a headless browser instance. Then you install Deno, because whilst you may have Deno installed on your host machine, it won't be from within docker unless you tell it to.

    li
      p Create your docker compose file.
      code-block(title="/path/to/your/project/docker-compose.yml" language="yaml")
        | version: '3'
        |
        | services:
        |   chrome:
        |     container_name: my_app
        |     build:
        |       context: .
        |       dockerfile: app.dockerfile
        |     volumes:
        |       - ./src:/var/www/my-app
        |     command: bash -c "deno test --allow-run --allow-net"
        |     working_dir: /var/www/my-app
      p Here, you are creating your docker-compose file, which will start/run your container, and execute your test file.

      p Create your test file.
      code-block(title="/path/to/your/project/src/app_test.ts" language="typescript")
        | import { HeadlessBrowser } from "https://deno.land/x/sinco@{{ $conf.sinco.latest_version }}/mod.ts";
        |
        | Deno.test("My web app works as expected", async () => {
        |   const Sinco = new HeadlessBrowser();
        |   await Sinco.build();
        |   await Sinco.goTo("https://chromestatus.com");
        |   await Sinco.click('a[href="/features/schedule"]');
        |   await Sinco.waitForPageChange();
        |   await Sinco.assertUrlIs("https://chromestatus.com/features/schedule");
        |   await Sinco.done();
        | })
      p Here you are going to create your headless browser instance, and navigate to <code>https://chromestatus.com</code>. Once the page has loaded, you will click an element matching the <code>a[href="/features/schedule"]</code> selector, which will send you to a different page. To assert this, you are going to use <code>.assertUrlIs()</code> to assert the page you are currently on, has now changed.

      code-block(title="Terminal" language="shell-session")
        | $ docker-compose build
        | $ docker-compose up
    li
      p All of your tests should pass, and your docker container should exit successfully.
